# About

This is a library for creating force-directed graph _interfaces_ for viewing and interacting with nested comments.

It allows you to build stuff like this ![](https://github.com/prudentbot/nebula/blob/master/resources/lookslikethis.png)

Really, it's just a wrapper around the d3 force-directed graph layout, but it makes some opinionated choices about the best way to interact with comments as force-directed nodes and so the idea is that there's a lot of usable functionality pre-made at the expense of some customizability.

[There's a project ready-made for testing it here](https://github.com/prudentbot/reddit-nebula)

This is all very much work-in-progress.  Documentation on how to use it is coming soon.  Currently very open to opinions/suggestions for the overall design.
